# 🧪 FinTech App Testing Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing tools and instructions for verifying all features of your FinTech application. We've created both automated and manual testing approaches to ensure everything works correctly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Automated Testing (Recommended)

**Files Created:**
- `test_all_features.mjs` - Comprehensive automated test suite
- `setup_test.mjs` - Setup instructions

**Steps:**
1. Get your Supabase credentials:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > API
   - Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

2. Update `test_all_features.mjs`:
   ```javascript
   const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
   const supabaseKey = 'your-anon-key';
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   node test_all_features.mjs
   ```

### 2. Manual Testing

**File Created:**
- `test_web_app.md` - Comprehensive manual test checklist

**Steps:**
1. Open the checklist in `test_web_app.md`
2. Go through each test manually in your browser
3. Check off completed tests
4. Note any issues found
