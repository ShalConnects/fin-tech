-- Fix Purchase to Transaction Sync Complete
-- This script ensures that ALL fields sync from purchase to transaction, not just price

-- 1. Drop existing sync functions and triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_purchase_price_trigger ON purchases;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_transaction_price_trigger ON transactions;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_purchase_price();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS sync_transaction_price();

-- 2. Create improved function to sync ALL purchase fields with transaction
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_purchase_to_transaction()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    old_amount DECIMAL;
    account_id UUID;
    transaction_type TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- When a purchase is updated, sync ALL fields with the linked transaction
    IF NEW.transaction_id IS NOT NULL THEN
        -- Get the current transaction details for account balance calculation
        SELECT t.amount, t.account_id, t.type 
        INTO old_amount, account_id, transaction_type
        FROM transactions t 
        WHERE t.id = NEW.transaction_id;
        
        -- Update ALL transaction fields to match purchase
        UPDATE transactions 
        SET 
            amount = NEW.price,
            description = NEW.item_name,
            category = NEW.category,
            updated_at = NOW()
        WHERE id = NEW.transaction_id;
        
        -- Update account balance if price changed
        IF account_id IS NOT NULL AND old_amount IS NOT NULL AND NEW.price != OLD.price THEN
            IF transaction_type = 'expense' THEN
                -- For expenses: remove old amount, add new amount (negative adjustment)
                UPDATE accounts 
                SET balance = balance + old_amount - NEW.price,

SELECT

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_purchase_transaction_sync()

    transaction_description TEXT,
    purchase_category TEXT,

SELECT * FROM test_purchase_transaction_sync();
